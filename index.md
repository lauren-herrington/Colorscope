## Musical Kaliedoscope Table

  Our most popular product is the Musical Kaleidoscope Table. This product provides an interactive way to stimulate a person's auditory, tactile, and visual senses. When the cranks and wheels are turned, they activate the kaleidoscope projection above and individual musical instruments. All the while, the outside of the MKT has fun colorful gears rotating to simulate the work the patient is putting into the device.
